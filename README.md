# python_revision
# this repository is for my python revision and anyone new to python can make use of it as well
# the book used in this revision is python crash course for dummmies ( it is a free pdf available online )
# the book is needed if someone is interested in using this repository file to learn the basics of python
# at the starting chapters the documentation is a bit poor but the earlier chapters are quiet easy to grasp so no one would have a problem following 
# i tried my best to provide solutions to each exercise in the book and thats the main purpose of this repository to help people see some solutions to the exercises 
# some solutiions are not posted here, i feel they weere some sort of a repeat of the previous question and didn't bother solving again. anyone who intends on posting their solution is free to add them.
